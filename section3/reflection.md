## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  * I liked the acronym of SMART pertaining to setting goals. It stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Often times I struggle to make solid goals, and just have a vague idea of what I want to achieve. This hinders my success and progress, and never gives me a feeling of accomplishment and pride like meeting a goal with specific parameters would. This is something I will definitely keep in mind and implement going forward.
  * In the video, I loved how Carmen explained her personal experience and what a growth mindset means to her. What really resonated with me is when she said "Some people believe their capabilities are set, they are born with them and they never change." This is absolutely something I have struggled with and been told throughout my life, and internalized as a belief about myself. It has caused me to struggle with my self esteem and beliefs about myself. I think I can benefit greatly from adopting a growth mindset and changing my outlook on myself and my work in that way. Also I just love Carmen, the way she articulated herself and her struggles was really relatable and that was nice to see.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I think that I love to learn and enjoy the process. I think that's really the basis of a growth mindset, is wanting to learn and improve. A lot of the actual actions that are a part of the growth mindset I could definitely work on however. Setting clear goals, being forgiving of myself for struggling, and being comfortable seeking challenges and help are all things I will work on going forward.

* What is something you are good at or knowledgeable at now, that you once weren't? How did you get those skills/knowledge? Was it hard at some point?

When I got promoted at my job to management, I was not very good at it at first. It was pretty difficult for me to hold boundaries with my employees because they were my friends, and it was hard to learn all the new technology I needed to use. I asked my supervisor for help and just had to practice my managerial skills even though it was uncomfortable. I got a lot more comfortable and confident as time went on, but it was definitely hard at a lot of points.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

A Hash is similar to an array in that it stores information in a list format. However, while an array only stores individual values, hashes store pairs of key/values. Similar to a dictionary, the key is the 'word' and the value is the 'definition'.


1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

pet_store = {'dog_food' => 100, 'treats' => 88, 'toys' => 45}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

states['IA']

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

states.keys
states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

A good example of when to use a hash is when storing information to describe something. For example to make a calendar we can use a hash to pair activities with the times they are scheduled for. This example would use a hash rather than an array because the activities/times need to be paired, it doesn't work to just list them out separately.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?

I don't think I have questions, just feel a little shaky on writing them out so I will be getting more practice on these.
