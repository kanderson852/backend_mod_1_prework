## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  Learning has always been something I love to do and am passionate about. However, it has been a bit of a struggle at times because of my ADHD and some of the resulting poor learning habits I have formed. This has caused me to have a bit of a love-hate relationship with learning that I would like to get back to a loving relationship.
  Some of the habits from the article that I already have down pretty well are enjoying the learning process and not just the end result, having a growth mindset, and taking (relatively) good care of my brain and body. What I want to do more of from the list is reading, practicing by teaching, and taking short breaks often and longer breaks as needed instead of just cramming!
  If I were to add to my own personal list of things to work on it would be planning ahead and arranging my time in a way that sets me up for success.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

`print "Hello World!"`

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
 "#"

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

 An integer is a rounded number, whereas a float includes a decimal place.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

`animal = "zebra"`

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

`p "#{animal}"`

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

Interpolation builds strings that contain variables within them
 `p "My favorite animal is the #{animal}."`

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

`gets.chomp`

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

One common string method is `.length`. This allows you to print the length of the string that you use it on. Another common string is `.sub` which replaces the specified string with another one.
